For Those of you that do not know how to install these dupes and expressions continue to read this file, if you already know how to install them dont worry about reading this.

To install the files you simply drag the garrysmod folder into Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\ and it should go in the right folders. 
If that does not work just place the Expression2 files in Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\expression2 and the dupes in Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\advdupe2
